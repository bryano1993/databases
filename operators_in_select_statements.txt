1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.

    SELECT <column1, column2, ... *>
    FROM <table1, table2 ...>
    <optional: WHERE <condition>>

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

    SELECT (Super)
    FROM (Fast)
    WHERE (Walrus)

3.Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

    Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

    SELECT name, gender , age
    FROM dogs
    WHERE title LIKE '%Labrador';

    Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

    SELECT id
    FROM dogs
    WHERE age < 1;

    Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

    SELECT name, age
    FROM dogs
    WHERE gender LIKE '%F'
    AND weight > 351;

    Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

    SELECT *
    FROM dogs
    WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd';

    Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.

    SELECT id, age, weight, breed
    FROM dogs
    WHERE weight > 60
    OR breed LIKE 'great dane';

4.Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

    SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

    'Mushi'     '2016-03-22'
    'Seashell'   NULL
    'Azul'      '2016-04-17'
    'Victoire'  '2016-09-01'
    'Nala'       NULL

    SELECT name, age FROM cats;

    'Mushi'     1
    'Seashell'  7
    'Azul'      3
    'Victoire'  7
    'Nala'      1

5.From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.

    Display all the information about all of the available cats.

    SELECT *
    FROM cats

    Choose one cat of each age to show to potential adopters.
    
    SELECT *
    FROM cats
    WHERE id <= 3;


    Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.

    SELECT names
    FROM cats;

6.List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!

    > Greater than ex)  find the age of students that are greater than 5 feet.
    < Less than ex) find the number of students in the classroom that are less than 14 years old
    = Equal to  ex) set variable x to 10
    <= less or equal to   ex) find the height of the waterbottle if it is less than or equal a width of 5 cm
    >= greater than or equal to   ex) find a person who can code projects with lines of code greater than or equal 1000
    != not equal to   ex) find the product of a number that does not equal 50

7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?

    SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;

    'Seashell'
    'Nala'

    SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;

    'Mushi'
    'Seashell'
    'Victoire'
    'Nala'

    SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
